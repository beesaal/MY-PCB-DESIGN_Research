When setting up your STM32F407IGT6 MCU for programming and debugging via an ST-Link MCU (STM32F103C8T6), you need to establish proper connections between the JTAG/SWD pins of both MCUs. A solder bridge might be necessary depending on your PCB design and the connection scheme. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Key Connections for JTAG/SWD Interface

For programming and debugging the STM32F407IGT6 using the STM32F103C8T6 as an ST-Link, the following connections are typically required:

1.  **TCK (Test Clock)**: Connects the clock signal.
2.  **TMS (Test Mode Select)**: Controls the JTAG state machine.
3.  **TDI (Test Data In)**: Serial input data (not used in SWD mode).
4.  **TDO (Test Data Out)**: Serial output data (not used in SWD mode).
5.  **TRST (Test Reset)**: Optional reset signal.
6.  **SWDIO (Serial Wire Debug I/O)**: Bi-directional data line for SWD.
7.  **SWCLK (Serial Wire Clock)**: Clock signal for SWD.
8.  **NRST (Reset)**: MCU reset line.

### SWD vs. JTAG

-   **SWD (Serial Wire Debug)**: Uses fewer pins (SWDIO, SWCLK, NRST).
-   **JTAG**: Uses more pins (TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO, TRST, NRST).

### Using ST-Link with STM32F103C8T6

To program and debug the STM32F407IGT6 using the STM32F103C8T6 as an ST-Link, ensure the following connections:

#### SWD Connections (Recommended for Simplicity)

1.  **SWDIO (PA13 on STM32F407IGT6)** to **SWDIO (PA13 on STM32F103C8T6)**
2.  **SWCLK (PA14 on STM32F407IGT6)** to **SWCLK (PA14 on STM32F103C8T6)**
3.  **NRST (Reset, optional but recommended)** to **NRST (Reset on STM32F103C8T6)**
4.  **GND** to **GND**

#### JTAG Connections (If Required)

1.  **TCK (PA14 on STM32F407IGT6)** to **TCK (PA14 on STM32F103C8T6)**
2.  **TMS (PA13 on STM32F407IGT6)** to **TMS (PA13 on STM32F103C8T6)**
3.  **TDI (PB15 on STM32F407IGT6)** to **TDI (PB15 on STM32F103C8T6)**
4.  **TDO (PB14 on STM32F407IGT6)** to **TDO (PB14 on STM32F103C8T6)**
5.  **TRST (PB4 on STM32F407IGT6, if used)** to **TRST (PB4 on STM32F103C8T6)**
6.  **NRST (Reset, optional but recommended)** to **NRST (Reset on STM32F103C8T6)**
7.  **GND** to **GND**

### Solder Bridges

#### When Are Solder Bridges Required?

Solder bridges are small, intentional solder connections on a PCB that can be used to enable or disable certain connections. They are often used in designs to provide flexibility during manufacturing and testing.

-   **To Enable Connection**: If your PCB design includes optional connections for JTAG/SWD signals (e.g., connecting or isolating TDO, TMS, TRST, TDI, TCK), you might need to create a solder bridge to establish these connections.
-   **To Disable Connection**: Similarly, if you need to isolate certain signals, you might need to break an existing solder bridge.

#### Why Use Solder Bridges?

1.  **Flexibility**: They allow you to configure the PCB for different modes or uses without redesigning the PCB.
2.  **Debugging**: Solder bridges can help isolate issues during debugging by enabling or disabling specific connections.
3.  **Manufacturing**: During production, you can leave solder bridges open and only connect them when necessary for final testing or configuration.

### Example Scenario

If your design uses the STM32F103C8T6 to program and debug the STM32F407IGT6 via SWD, you might not need TDI, TDO, or TRST connections, simplifying the setup. However, if your design includes optional JTAG functionality, you might have pads or jumpers for these connections.

    ```sh

    `- Ensure SWDIO, SWCLK, and NRST are directly connected.
    - If JTAG is also supported, use solder bridges to connect TDI, TDO, TCK, TMS, and TRST when needed.`

### Conclusion

Solder bridges are useful for providing flexibility in connecting JTAG/SWD signals between the STM32F407IGT6 and the STM32F103C8T6. Whether they are required depends on your specific PCB design and how you plan to use the debugging/programming interface. For SWD, you only need a few connections, which might not require solder bridges unless you need to optionally enable/disable certain features.
