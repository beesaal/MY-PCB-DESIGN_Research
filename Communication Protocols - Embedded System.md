-   **Usage:** Used in embedded systems for audio applications, connecting microphones, speakers, and audio codecs.

**c. SDIO (Secure Digital Input/Output):**

-   **Description:** Protocol for interfacing with SD cards.
-   **Usage:** Enables embedded systems to expand storage capacity using SD cards for data logging, multimedia applications, etc.

**d. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface):**

-   **Description:** Protocol for musical instrument communication.
-   **Usage:** Used in electronic musical instruments and equipment for transmitting musical data between devices.

**e. Proprietary Sensor Protocols:**

-   **Description:** Various protocols specific to sensor types and manufacturers.
-   **Usage:** Each sensor type (e.g., temperature sensors, accelerometers) may have its own protocol for communicating data to embedded systems.

### Additional Notes:

-   **Diversity:** This list covers widely used protocols, but there are numerous niche or less common protocols used in specialized applications.
-   **Development:** New protocols continually emerge to meet evolving needs in embedded systems technology.
-   **Selection Criteria:** Protocol choice depends on factors like data rate, power consumption, distance, cost, and specific application requirements.

This hierarchy provides a structured view of how different communication protocols are categorized and where they are typically employed within embedded systems.
