#### Overview

The USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is a versatile communication protocol that supports both synchronous and asynchronous data transmission modes. This capability makes USART more flexible compared to UART, which only supports asynchronous communication.

#### Key Features

-   **Synchronous and Asynchronous Modes**: USART can operate in synchronous mode, where data is synchronized with a clock signal, or in asynchronous mode, similar to UART, without a clock signal.
-   **Duplex Communication**: Supports full-duplex communication, allowing simultaneous data transmission and reception.
-   **Configurable Data Frame**: Supports various configurations for data bits, parity bits, and stop bits.
-   **Baud Rate Generation**: Capable of generating a wide range of baud rates for different communication needs.
-   **Error Detection**: Provides mechanisms for error detection, including parity check and framing error detection.

#### Operation Modes

1.  **Asynchronous Mode**:

    -   Data is transmitted without a clock signal.
    -   Uses start and stop bits to indicate the beginning and end of each data packet.
    -   Similar to UART operation.
2.  **Synchronous Mode**:

    -   Data is transmitted with a clock signal that synchronizes the sender and receiver.
    -   Requires an additional clock line (SCK) along with Tx and Rx lines.
    -   No need for start and stop bits, as data synchronization is maintained by the clock signal.

#### Data Transmission

-   **Asynchronous Transmission**:

    -   Data is framed with start, data, optional parity, and stop bits.
    -   Baud rate must be configured the same on both transmitter and receiver.
-   **Synchronous Transmission**:

    -   Data is transmitted continuously without start and stop bits.
    -   Clock signal ensures that data bits are synchronized between sender and receiver.

#### Applications

-   **Embedded Systems**: Used in microcontrollers and embedded systems for flexible communication needs.
-   **Peripheral Communication**: Interfaces with various peripherals that require synchronous or asynchronous communication.
-   **Networking**: Utilized in networked systems where precise data synchronization is essential.

### Difference Between UART and USART

| Feature | UART | USART |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mode of Operation | Asynchronous only | Synchronous and asynchronous |
| Clock Signal | No clock signal | Uses clock signal in synchronous mode |
| Communication Lines | Tx, Rx | Tx, Rx, and SCK (in synchronous mode) |
| Start and Stop Bits | Used to frame data | Used in asynchronous mode, not in synchronous mode |
| Data Synchronization | Based on matching baud rates | Based on clock signal in synchronous mode |
| Flexibility | Less flexible, simpler implementation | More flexible, supports multiple modes |
| Applications | Simple, low-cost serial communication | Versatile, suitable for both synchronous and asynchronous communication |

### Summary

-   **UART** is suitable for simple, asynchronous communication needs where data synchronization is managed by matching baud rates on both devices.
-   **USART** offers more versatility by supporting both synchronous and asynchronous modes, making it suitable for applications requiring precise data synchronization with a clock signal.

Understanding both UART and USART is essential for designing robust communication systems in embedded applications, where the choice of protocol depends on the specific requirements of the system.
